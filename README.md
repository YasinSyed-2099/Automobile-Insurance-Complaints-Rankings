- Early years (2009–2012) show high premiums and high complaints, reflecting larger customer base.

**Complaint Ratio Insights:**  
- Peak in 2019 (0.16) indicates service issues increased relative to business scale.  
- Recent years (2022–2023) show lower ratios (0.0516–0.0670), reflecting improved service management.

**Upheld vs Not Upheld Complaints:**  
- Earlier years had a high number of upheld complaints → more valid complaints.  
- Later years show lower upheld complaints, sometimes higher not upheld → better complaint resolution.


## **Key Insights**
- **Service Improvement:** Allstate shows better complaint handling over the last 5 years.  
- **High Impact Years:** 2009–2012 and 2019 were peak complaint years, key for analysis.  
- **Premium Trend:** Gradual decline may reflect market or regulatory changes.  
- **Complaint Ratio Observations:** Peaks in certain years indicate periods requiring attention to service quality.  
- **Upheld vs Not Upheld Analysis:** Trends in upheld vs not upheld complaints reveal how effectively the company resolved customer issues over time.
